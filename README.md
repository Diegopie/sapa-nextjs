## Things to optimize

Moving images out of the public folder and into a cdn or even just an s3 bucket to avoid aggressive caching/cost issues of Vercel optimizing images through the public folder

Add a caching config since the home page won't necessarily change all that much

Add some more seo focused items like keywords, robot, and site index files
