# Image Placeholders

This folder should contain the following images:

1. `utah-grown-logo.png` - The main logo for Utah Grown
2. `utah-landscape.jpg` - A landscape image of Utah for the hero section

Since we can't upload these images directly, you'll need to add them manually. In the meantime, the site is using Next.js placeholder images.

## Image Recommendations

### Utah Grown Logo
- Size: 350px × 180px
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Description: A green logo with "UTAH GROWN" text and possibly a cannabis leaf symbol

### Utah Landscape
- Size: At least 1600px × 800px for good quality on larger screens
- Format: JPG or WebP
- Description: A panoramic view of Utah's red rock landscape, possibly with Monument Valley or similar iconic Utah scenery
- The image should be tinted green in the site to match the cannabis theme
